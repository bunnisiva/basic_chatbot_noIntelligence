# basic_chatbot_noIntelligence
This is a super easy conversational AI that is based on mapping words through dictionaries in python
I enjoyed reading Nagesh's blog on Towards Data Science.
I made my own female bot :) and developed this in a more pythonic way :)
Anyone interested to understand the bots and their psychology :) this is a good one.
Once we implement with LSTMs and GRU's with attention  they will become Smarty pants :)
